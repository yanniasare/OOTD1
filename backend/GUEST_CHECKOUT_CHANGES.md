     "customer": {
       "firstName": "Akosua",
       "lastName": "Mensah", 
       "email": "customer@example.com",
       "phone": "+233244123456"
     },
     "items": [...],
     "shipping": {...},
     "paymentMethod": "paystack"
   }
   ```

2. **Get Orders by Email**

   GET /api/orders/customer@example.com
   ```

3. **Get Single Order**
   ```
   GET /api/orders/order/ORDER_ID
   ```

4. **Cancel Order**
   ```
   PUT /api/orders/ORDER_ID/cancel
   {
     "email": "customer@example.com"
   }
